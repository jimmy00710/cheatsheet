    "Q. Why traditional algorithm and MLP don't work that well compare to CNN ? <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "A.  Traditional algorithm can't find the deep features or complex relation between the data. Along with this, since before feeding the data we will be flatteing the data. <b><i> This flatten data will remove the spatial information from the image. </b></i> <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "MLPs(Multilayer Perceptron) in simple terms are fully connected layers. They use one perceptron for each input and the amount of weights rapidly becomes unmanageable for large images. It includes too many parameters because it is fully connected. Each node is connected to every other node in next and previous layer, forming a very dense web- resulting in <b><i> redundancy and inefficiency </b></i>. As a result, difficulties arise whilst training and overfitting can occur which make it lose the ability to generalize. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Another problem is that MLPs react differently to an input and its shifted version- they are not <b><i> translation invariant. </b></i>. \n",
    "For example, if a picture of a cat appears in the top left of the image in one picture and the bottom right of another picture, the MLP will try to correct itself and assume that a cat will always appear in this section of image.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, MLPs are not the best idea to use for image processing. One of the main problems is that spatial information is lost when the image is flattened(matrix to vector) into an MLP. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So there are 3 problems - \n",
    "> Redundancy of features <br>\n",
    "> Translation Invariant <br>\n",
    "> Spatial Information <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<br> \n",
    "\n",
    "The CNN solve all these three problems in the following way- <br> \n",
    "\n",
    "Spatial Information - Due to CNN structure, they develop an internal representation of a two dimensional image. This allows the model to learn position and scale in-variant structure in the data, which is important when working with images.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Translation Invariant - Due to Convolution operation, the CNN tends to find the <b><i> local connectivity </b></i>.  in an image according to certain size and stride, allows the filter to find and match patterns no matter where the pattern is located in a given image.\n",
    "\n",
    "Redundancy - The weights are smaller and shared- less wastefulm easier to train than MLP and more effective too. Layers are sparsely connected rather than fully connected. <br> \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "CNN’s leverage the fact that nearby pixels are more strongly related than distant ones. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "We analyze the influence of nearby pixels by using something called a filter /Kernel and we move this across the image from top left to bottom right. For each point on the image, a value is calculated based on the filter using a convolution operation.\n",
    "A filter could be related to anything, for pictures of humans, one filter could be associated with seeing noses, and our nose filter would give us an indication of how strongly a nose seems to appear in our image, and how many times and in what locations they occur. This reduces the number of weights that the neural network must learn compared to an MLP, and also means that when the location of these features changes it does not throw the neural network off.\n",
    "The panning of filters (you can set the stride and filter size) in CNN essentially allows parameter sharing, weight sharing so that the filter looks for a specific pattern, and is location invariant — can find the pattern anywhere in an image. This is very useful for object detection. Patterns can be discovered in more than one part of the image.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, it can also find the similar pattern even if the object is somewhat rotated/tilted using a concept called Pooling, which makes CNN more robust to changes in the position of the feature in the image, referred to by the technical phrase <b><i>“local translation\n",
    "invariance.”</b></i>\n",

The tanh function has been mostly used in recurrent neural networks for natural language processing and speech recognition tasks. <br>\n",

    "However, the tanh function, too, has a limitation – just like the sigmoid function, it cannot solve the vanishing gradient problem. Also, the tanh function can only attain a gradient of 1 when the input value is 0 (x is zero). As a result, the function can produce some dead neurons during the computation process."
